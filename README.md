Creating an invoice system for practice.

# description
The front end contains a form. Users can enter information in the form and hit a submit button.

The submit button send the form data to the back end.

The back end "processes" the data by appending the text "is processed" at the end of the first name, last name, item, and price.

The result is then sent back to the front end.

The front end then displays the text on the screen.

This practice project does NOT use a database.
